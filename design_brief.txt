The main component of my web pages would be black and bright color such as red, blue, green, orange. Whatever can make my main content stands out.
I have visited some websites such as https://www.awwwards.com/, what I liked from it is: 
1. It looks organize
2. Specific about what is displaying on the thumbnail, and name of the person who made the work.
I also visit https://thefwa.com/

What I liked are: the contract colors between black and white, and dark colors. They made it interesting when the thumbnail is gradually move up as I scroll down.

I also visited http://www.htmlinspiration.com/
It looks totally contract with the  thefwa.com/, when thefwa.com/ has black and white and dark colors, this web pages has variable colors for each topic. 

My topics would be the city at night and its beautiful when It comes to night. I chose it because I saw the city at night when I flew from US to TaiWan. My second topic is the famous places in the world. Finally, it is beautiful world around us at a random place. People don't really know where are the beautiful places at a place. All people know are the famous places and they think those places are beautiful. However, this'll prove them wrong. everything has it own secret and its beautifulness.
